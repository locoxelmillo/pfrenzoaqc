            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am an engineer with an overflowing passion for industrial automation. 
            My career has been an exciting mix of management, maintenance, and programming involving robots, PLCs, and HMIs. 
            Over the years, I've worked as a contractor, leading projects that streamline industrial processes and harness the full power of technology. 
            Technology fascinates me, and my constant goal is to find innovative ways to apply it to enhance efficiency and productivity. 
            My recent arrival in New Zealand with a Working Holiday visa provides me with the opportunity to bring my expertise and enthusiasm to a new stage.
            I'm thrilled about exploring fresh opportunities in the field of industrial automation in this vibrant setting. 
            My focus is always on personal and professional growth.
